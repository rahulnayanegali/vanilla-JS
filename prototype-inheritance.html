		//What is prototype?
		/*
		when I say prototype in js, then I am referring to [[prototype]] or __proto__ or getPrototypeOf(obj).

		From now onwards I'll refer prototype as __proto__.

		So __proto__ is an object inside javascript object. 
		*/

		let obj =  {}; // is same as let obj = new Object();
		// Uncomment to see results in the console.
		//console.log(obj)


		/* 
		Ouput will be 
		{
			__proto__: Object
		}
		What this means is by default javascript engine, initializes __proto__ named property to newly created object.

		value of the __proto__ will always be equal to prototype property of the parent constructor.
		*/
		// What??!! Hey!! WAIT a second....!!, Now what the hell is `prototype property of the parent constructor function or class`????

		/*
		`Prototype` property in javascript has nothing todo with __proto__ of an object. For some time just rename 
		prototype property = constructor property. We will come to this later. 
		*/

		// lets understand how __proto__ works.

		let person = {
			name: 'Rahul',
			age: 24,
		}
		console.log(person)

		let programmer = {
			job: 'Engineer',
		}
		console.log(programmer)

		/* as we can see __proto__ having its value equal to Object. This means as I have already mentioned in line 30, value is always by default equal to prototype property of the parent class.*/

		// To understand the use of __proto__
		console.log(programmer.name); // undefined
		
		// As name is not defined for programmer but it is defined for person object.

		/* I will change the value of __proto__ of programmer object to person object */

		
		//** Even __proto__ is also an object by nature.

		programmer.__proto__ = person;
		console.log(programmer.name);
